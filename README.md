# Plataforma de Incentivo Corporativo

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## 💡 About the Project

This platform helps companies engage and reward their employees through a smart point-based incentive system.  
Managers or the system itself define performance goals, employees earn points upon validation, and those points can be redeemed for real rewards.

💼 For HR and business managers  
🎯 For operational, sales, and administrative teams  
🎁 Full logistics included: we handle the product sourcing and delivery  

Some key features:
- Goal management and automatic point tracking  
- User and admin dashboards  
- Reward catalog with real-time stock  
- Role-based views and permissions  
- Custom plans and pricing logic
